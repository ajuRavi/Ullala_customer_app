    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    E8:BE:F2:42:F9:69:D9:C1:3A:8F:09:34:1D:F1:D6:BC:55:51:BE:B4

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    E8:BE:F2:42:F9:69:D9:C1:3A:8F:09:34:1D:F1:D6:BC:55:51:BE:B4

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
